## About Me

**Angelina S. Caggiano** is a PhD candidate in Civil Engineering at UMass Amherst, specializing in **transportation safety**. Her master‚Äôs thesis examined driver comprehension of traffic control devices, focusing on vulnerable road user infrastructure such as the **Pedestrian Hybrid Beacon (PHB)**. Building on this work, her doctoral research explores policies defining vulnerable road users to recommend improvements to crash reporting. She also studies pedestrian behavior at PHBs and models crashes based on user interactions, aiming to inform equitable policy changes, enhance safety, and influence user behavior through education and outreach.

## Experience

Angelina‚Äôs diverse internship experiences have strengthened her expertise in **transportation safety** and **intelligent transportation systems**, providing her with a comprehensive understanding of the transportation profession.  

As a young woman in a male-dominated field, she values strong **mentorship** in both academic and professional settings. She has mentored numerous undergraduate students through research projects and professional organizations such as [ITE](https://www.ite.org/) and [WTS](https://www.wtsinternational.org/). Committed to education, she developed and teaches *Transportation and Smart Cities*, a first-year course designed to inspire interest in transportation careers.

## Goals & Vision

Angelina aspires to become a **professor**, advancing transportation safety research, mentoring future engineers, and promoting diversity and innovation in the field.
